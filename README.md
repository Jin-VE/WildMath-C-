# WildMath-C-Sharp
C# Class Library for Dr. Norman Wildberger's "Maxel Theory"

The WildMath library defines some of the mathematical structures described by Dr. Wildberger in his Math Foundations series.
Currently included are Pixel, Maxel, and a generic Mset.

This is a Visual Studio 2015 solution.

This project is in the public domain. Please attribute any derivations appropriately.

This is work in progress. Contributors are welcome.

Notes:

The mathematical operators of the Maxel class follow the 'Tropical' notation.
