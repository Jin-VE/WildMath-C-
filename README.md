# WildMath-C-Sharp
C# Class Library for Dr. Norman Wildberger's "Maxel Theory"

The WildMath library defines some of the mathematical structures described by Dr. Wildberger in his Math Foundations series.
Currently included are:  
* Pixel, Maxel, Vexel, and a generic Mset  
* A Vexel usage example involving prime-factored objects  
* A testing loop which tests randomly generated Vexels and Maxels for consistency

This is a Visual Studio 2015 solution.

This is work in progress. Contributors are welcome.

Notes:

The mathematical operators of the classes follow the 'Tropical' notation.
