# WildMath-C-Sharp
C# Class Library for Norman Wildberger

The WildMath library defines some of the mathematical structures described by Dr. Wildberger in his Math Foundations series.
Currently included are Pixel, Maxel, and a generic Mset.

This is a work in progress. Nothing has been verified.

This is a Visual Studio 2015 solution. It has only just begun and so it is incomplete and probably has bugs.
